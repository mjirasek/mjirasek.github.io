Well, this is the kind of project you cannot bring as an example of your skills to a serious interview. Yet, it is fairly well appreciated, published in ACS Central Science with significant impact in the field of astrobiology and molecular complexity.

"Alien Detector" is our colloquial name for what is formally known as Assembly Theory-based Molecular Complexity Detection. This groundbreaking research presents the first experimentally quantifiable approach to determining molecular assembly complexity, a potential biosignature for detecting life.

Our approach revolutionizes how we quantify molecular complexity by using Assembly Theory, a framework that measures the minimum number of steps required to construct a molecule from its building blocks. The key insight: molecules with high assembly indices (MA > 15) are too complex to form by chance and likely indicate biological or technological origins.

## Breaking New Ground in Astrobiology

What makes this work particularly exciting is that we've developed three independent experimental methods to rapidly estimate molecular assembly indices. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) works by counting different carbon environments, with quaternary carbons contributing most to complexity. Infrared Spectroscopy (IR) analyzes peak counts in the fingerprint region (400-1500 cm⁻¹). Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) uses a recursive algorithm to map fragmentation patterns to assembly pathways.

## The "Alien" Connection

The nickname "Alien Detector" comes from the profound implication of this work: we can now experimentally detect molecular signatures of life without knowing what we're looking for. This has direct applications for astrobiology missions to Mars, Enceladus, and Titan, origin of life studies on Earth, and detecting technosignatures, which are molecular evidence of technological civilizations.

The beauty of our approach is its model-free nature. Unlike traditional methods that require knowing a molecule's structure, we can assess complexity directly from spectroscopic data, making it perfect for analyzing unknown samples from extraterrestrial environments.

## Technical Achievement

We demonstrated our methods on datasets of 10,000+ molecules computationally and ~100 molecules experimentally. The correlation coefficients between predicted and actual molecular assembly values were impressive. Combined techniques showed 0.88-0.91 correlation, individual methods showed 0.73-0.87 correlation, and we successfully distinguished high-complexity biomolecules from simple compounds with similar molecular weights.

## Impact and Recognition

This work represents a paradigm shift in how we approach the search for life beyond Earth. By providing an experimentally measurable complexity metric, we've created a tool that could revolutionize astrobiology.

The research has already garnered significant attention in the scientific community and has implications for understanding the fundamental principles that distinguish living systems from non-living chemistry.

Who knows? Maybe one day this "Alien Detector" will actually detect aliens. Until then, it's helping us understand the fundamental principles that distinguish living systems from non-living chemistry and that's pretty extraordinary in itself.
