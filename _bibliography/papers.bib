	abstract = {Chemputation is the process of programming chemical robots to do experiments using a universal symbolic language, but the literature can be error prone and hard to read due to ambiguities. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains, including natural language processing, robotic control, and more recently, chemistry. Despite significant advancements in standardizing the reporting and collection of synthetic chemistry data, the automatic reproduction of reported syntheses remains a labour-intensive task. In this work, we introduce an LLM-based chemical research agent workflow designed for the automatic validation of synthetic literature procedures. Our workflow can autonomously extract synthetic procedures and analytical data from extensive documents, translate these procedures into universal XDL code, simulate the execution of the procedure in a hardware-specific setup, and ultimately execute the procedure on an XDL-controlled robotic system for synthetic chemistry. This demonstrates the potential of LLM-based workflows for autonomous chemical synthesis with Chemputers. Due to the abstraction of XDL this approach is safe, secure, and scalable since hallucinations will not be chemputable and the XDL can be both verified and encrypted. Unlike previous efforts, which either addressed only a limited portion of the workflow, relied on inflexible hard-coded rules, or lacked validation in physical systems, our approach provides four realistic examples of syntheses directly executed from synthetic literature. We anticipate that our workflow will significantly enhance automation in robotically driven synthetic chemistry research, streamline data extraction, improve the reproducibility, scalability, and safety of synthetic and experimental chemistry.},

AT allows us to estimate the complexity of molecules by deducing the amount of shared information stored within them when . By examining 74 samples from a diverse range of biotic and abiotic sources, we used tandem MS data to detect 24102 analytes (9262 unique) and 59518 molecular fragments (6755 unique). Using this MS dataset, together with AT, we were able to infer the joint assembly spaces (JAS) of samples from molecular analytes. We show how JAS allows agnostic annotation of samples without fingerprinting exact analyte identities, facilitating accurate determination of their biogenicity and taxonomical grouping. Furthermore, we developed an AT-based framework to construct a biochemistry-agnostic phylogenetic tree which is consistent with genome-based models and outperforms other similarity-based algorithms. Finally, we were able to use AT to track colony lineages of a single bacterial species based on phenotypic variation in their molecular composition with high accuracy, which would be challenging to track with genomic data. Our results demonstrate how AT can expand causal molecular inference to non-sequence information without requiring exact molecular identities, thereby opening the possibility to study previously inaccessible biological domains.},

              Helquats are a recently introduced class of compounds, which can be perceived as a combination of helicenes with the skeleton of bispyridinium ions such as paraquat. In addition to their helical shape, some of these compounds can also adopt saddle‐like conformations. The focus here is on a specific [5]helquat dication

              2+
              , which is investigated by various experimental techniques in condensed media as well as in the gas phase in combination with parallel computational studies. For this compound, the helical form is strongly favored in the free dication

The NMR data reveal these ring currents directly, without needing analysis by density functional theory (DFT).

            New tetra‐ and di‐cationic azoniahelicenes provide electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) data reflecting their differences in electron transfer (ET) kinetics. Di‐cationic helquats containing two seven‐membered rings are irreversibly reduced in two ET steps. Substitution by redox‐active ethenylpyridinium in the α or γ position with respect to nitrogen atoms of the helquat core yields tetra‐cationic derivatives with reversible ET steps and communicating redox centres. Redox‐inactive substituents in di‐cationic azoniahelicenes retain ET irreversibility. Redox switching of ECD of tetra‐cationic enantiomers was observed. Unlike fully aromatic helquat, the ECD response of tetra‐cationic helquats to periodic reduction‐oxidation cycles is slower, owing to a strong adsorption on electrodes. Quantum chemical calculations (DFT) indicate that the first ET step of tetra‐cationic derivative substituted in the γ position yields a folded structure, which favours the internal donor‐acceptor interaction. This explains the spectroelectrochemical differences between both tetra‐cations.},

              Enantiopure alleno‐acetylenic ligands, containing two chiral allene moieties, assemble diastereoselectively with zinc(II) ions to form trinuclear triple‐stranded helicates, featuring two internal cavity binding sites (“helicages”). The addition of cycloalkanes or heteroalicycles results in inclusion complex formation with two guest molecules bound in one helicate. While no positive allosteric effects were observed, the chiroptical responses increased strongly upon complexation, with guest‐induced circular dichroism (ICD) signals reaching up to ΔΔ
