description: I am a research fellow and team leader in the Lee Cronin research group at the University of Glasgow, where my team specializes in AI-driven chemistry automation, robotic platforms, and autonomous experimentation. I oversee team performance, set objectives, and supervise individual projects spanning hardware development to machine learning implementation. Over the years, I have developed expertise across multiple disciplines through experience at leading institutions including Oxford, ETH Zurich, and Glasgow. I started my scientific career as an organic chemist, progressed through physical-organic chemistry, and eventually transitioned to autonomous chemistry and robotics. My current work integrates large language models with chemical robots, computer vision for experiment monitoring, and closed-loop optimization algorithms. I have co-authored 28 scientific publications (26 peer-reviewed papers) and one patent.
